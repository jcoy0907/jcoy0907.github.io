    <p class="text">The ModpackDlBot was created as a personal project to save on bandwith,
       because all minecraft modpack launchers require you to download the same
      mods over and over again. I decided to make my own modpack downloader
      that archives mods so that it saves curse extra stress, and saves time
      when downloading a modpack with a pre-downloaded mod.</p>
